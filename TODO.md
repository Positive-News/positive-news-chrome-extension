# URGENT
- TODO: seems to me that sometimes, an article title is in the cache, but it's still sent to the server for classification. WHY THIS BUG? (TRY TO REPRODUCE FIRST)

# MEDIUM

# LOW
- TODO: when a whole section (<div class="f9uzM"> for example) has all its articles hidden, hide the section too
- TODO: put elements of branding:
    - show number of negative articles removed on the page itself
- TODO: tooltip on all sunflow emoji to say "this article is selected by Positive News"

# DIFFICULT
- TODO: hiding articles FASTER
    - 1st way to do that: chunk articles into batches (like first 10 then all others) so that the top articles in the page are hidden FAST

- TODO: how can I verify that I indeed send a request to google to see fewer article like this
